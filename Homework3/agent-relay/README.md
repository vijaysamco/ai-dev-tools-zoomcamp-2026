# Agent Relay

Agent Relay is a small FastAPI service for registering agents, delivering one
task at a time, and recording results. PostgreSQL persists the queue and
attempts, while workers execute tasks on their own machines. The included
worker deterministically returns `input.upper()`.

## Run it

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> for the token-based local dashboard. The default
database is the Compose `postgres` service. `RELAY_DATABASE_URL` can be set to
connect to another PostgreSQL instance. `GET /health` is a liveness check and
`GET /ready` verifies database connectivity and schema.

For local development without Compose, install dependencies with `uv sync`,
start PostgreSQL, set `RELAY_DATABASE_URL`, and run:

```bash
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Register two identities and send a task:

```bash
alice=$(curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/agents \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"alice"}')
bob=$(curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/agents \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"uppercase"}')
```

The response contains each agent's secret `token` once. Keep it outside source
control. Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for all subsequent API calls;
registration is the only unauthenticated endpoint. For a shared installation,
set `RELAY_ENROLLMENT_SECRET` and send it as `X-Enrollment-Secret` when
registering.

## Run the deterministic worker

The worker can register itself and save credentials in a mode-0600 JSON file:

```bash
uv run python main.py worker \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
  --name uppercase \
  --credentials ./uppercase-credentials.json \
  --worker-id laptop-1
```

For failure/redelivery demonstrations, make local execution intentionally slow
and stop the process after one completion:

```bash
uv run python main.py worker --credentials ./uppercase-credentials.json \
  --slow-seconds 75 --worker-id slow-laptop
```

The worker heartbeats during long work. Killing it leaves the claim leased;
after the 60-second lease expires, another worker can claim the task with a new
token and incremented attempt number. `RELAY_LEASE_SECONDS` and
`RELAY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` are configurable server settings.

An existing credential can also be supplied explicitly (the token is not
written to disk):

```bash
uv run python main.py worker --agent-id agent_123 --token agt_… --worker-id laptop-2
```

## Storage and delivery behavior

`database.py` contains SQLAlchemy models and PostgreSQL transaction setup.
`storage.py` contains task/claim/recovery operations; routes and request models
are kept in `main.py` and `schemas.py`. PostgreSQL row locks with
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` make concurrent claims safe across API/worker
processes.

Claims are at-least-once and leased for 60 seconds by default. Heartbeats extend
an active lease. A completion or failure must include the recipient's bearer
token and claim token. Repeating the exact terminal request with that claim
token is idempotent; a stale token or different result receives `409`.

## Verify

The test suite covers the main protocol, sender/recipient access boundaries,
hashed claim-token behavior, idempotent terminal retries, concurrent claims,
lease expiry before and after recovery, pagination/error shape, and dashboard
asset serving:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

The first acceptance scenario can be exercised against a running relay and
its real database with:

```bash
RELAY_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 uv run pytest -q test_integration.py
```

On PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:RELAY_API_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
uv run pytest -q test_integration.py
```

The integration test registers two agents, sends a task, claims it, completes
it, and retrieves the persisted result through HTTP.

The protocol tests use an isolated SQLite database for speed. The integration
test uses the running PostgreSQL-backed API and does not reset its database.

This project intentionally does not include Kubernetes, external brokers, or
an LLM. Those are deployment concerns outside the local relay protocol.
